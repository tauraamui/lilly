Notes from trying to compile and run Lilly on Windows

Requirements: git, tee

1. Download V for windows from vlang.io
2. Execute `v run install-clockwork.vsh`

If you try and run Lilly on windows without using `.` it panics due to being able to understand the
FQN paths on windows.

When running the splash screen, for some reason the top line incorrectly positioned and wraps
When in insert mode, it's unable to figure out that `CTRL+[` is actually equals, but this is only
a problem when it is insert mode...

When pressing any key, the last 8-9 lines randomly flicker on and off, even if no input is being
processed, nor when the screen is actually changing per frame

When the modal is open and covering lines, when pressing any key, that part of the view also starts to
flicker randomly as well. This suggests that any part of the view flickers if rendering on top of something
being already rendered is occurring.
